# DurakScoreKeeper
Little Score Keeper for a card game

We play this card game during lunch and wanted a reliable way of keeping track of the loser.
Some of the features requested:
* Track performance per round.
* Ability to pick who is playing (just in case someone takes a day off)
* At the end of each week, reset stats
* Keep history of all games played
* Display who lost last week (so the people absent can see)
